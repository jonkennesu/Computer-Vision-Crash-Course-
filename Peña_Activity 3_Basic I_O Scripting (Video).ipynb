        "In this project, I was able to capture video from a webcam, show it in real time, and save it into a file of different formats using OpenCV. Proper management of video streams such as the frame size and frame rate had to be specified. An important lesson was proper usage of a loop that read and wrote frames continuously. I also learned how to record and stop the video output by creating a waitkey wherein the program will wait for the user to press any key or in this case \"q\".Overall, this project o gave a hands-on exposure to video processing and file handling in Python."
